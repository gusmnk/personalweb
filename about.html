      <p>
        My name is Gustavo, I live in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and I started
        learning web development by myself during the Covid-19 pandemic. <br>
        Freecodecamp, Udemy, Codecademy, and Youtube were my free learning
        sources. <br /><br />
        I still have a lot to learn, but I want to become a Web Developer and be
        able to work as a freelancer. I learned (and continue to learn) HTML,
        CSS, JAVASCRIPT, GIT, SASS, and more.
